# Sublime Text Projects Alfred Workflow #

View, filter and open your Sublime Text (2 and 3) project files.

![][demo]

## Installation ##

## Usage ##

- `.st [<query>]` — List/filter your `.sublime-project` files
	+ `↩` — Open result in Sublime Text
	+ `⌘+↩` — Reveal file in Finder
- `.stconfig` — Show the current settings
- `.sthelp` — View the included help file

**Note**: You can currently only alter the settings by editing the `settings.json` file by hand. Hit `↩` on the **Edit Configuration** item to open it in your default JSON editor.
