# Alfred-Viscosity #

Manage your [Viscosity][viscosity] VPN connections from [Alfred][alfred].

![Alfred-Viscosity in action][demo]


## Usage ##

- `vpn [<query>]` — View and filter Viscosity VPN connections.
    - `↩` — Connect/disconnect selected connection.

If you haven't entered a query, any active VPN connections will be shown at the top of the list. Action an active connection to disconnect it.

If you are connected to multiple VPNs, an additional "Disconnect All" item will be shown first.
